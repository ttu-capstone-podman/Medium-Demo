“Failure is only the opportunity to begin again more intelligently” - Henry Ford.  Podman is a container engine like docker that allows you to create and run containers that run programs so that you don’t have to install anything on a new system. The only issue with Podman is that it is extremely difficult to install on a mac. Our Solution was to create a turnkey solution to install Podman with minimal effort from the user. The team was comprised of 6 senior students studying computer science at Tennessee Tech University. During the fall semester of 2019, we were giving this problem by our client to solve as our capstone project. Our team was chosen by our professors based on similarities and compatibility. Team worked on the project throughout the remaining fall semester and all throughout the spring semester. We started out by creating an ansible script to install and setup Podman. Although we ran into some issues early on, we forged ahead and soon learned that plans can easily be changed.

We started on this in the second half of the fall semester and starting out the team had only a single Mac. This would present many issues and greatly slow down the process of developing the turnkey solution. Because we would only have one point to test our code and debug. This bottlenecked our development during this first semester. However, we would be able to overcome this obstacle if we got some additional Macs. To do this we needed to use the school's resources. The first option was to try and use the cyber range. The cyber range is a variety of virtual machines that are powered by servers on the school’s campus. However, due to Apple’s terms of service involving the hardware, we were unable to use the cyber range for our virtual machines. After this, we decided to consider using the school’s MacBooks. Again, we ran into some issues if we were to use these. Tennessee Tech’s technology use policy restricts students from having root access to any of the school’s computers. After this defeat, we were left with only the option of using cloud-based virtual machines. There were several providers we looked at. However, the service that best fulfilled our needs was MacInCloud. Once we decided we worked with our professor to acquire the virtual machines. To requisition the MacinCLoud VMs we provided a cost estimate to Tennessee Tech along with how long we expected to use the service. Despite our efforts, we would not be able to receive MacInCloud machines until week three of the next semester.

While we were working on acquiring the MacInCloud we were also working on starting the project. At the beginning of the project, several decisions had to be made. We decided to use Ansible at the request of the client. We also decided to use CentOS because both Ansible and CentOS are developed by Red Hat. This meant the chance for compatibility was greater. For the virtual machine to run we needed a hypervisor to run the virtual machine on; we decided on virtual box initially and later decided on Xhyve. Firstly, we created an Ansible script that would download and install the dependencies we would need or update them if they were not up to date.  Second, we had to setup a way to communicate with the Podman virtual machine from our host machine. To do this, we had to configure the Varlink interface. However, we hit our first major technical blocker when the Varlink interface would not correctly connect to the virtual machine via SSH. During this time, we had received word that we were finally going to receive our MacInCloud accounts.
<p>After receiving our MacInCloud accounts, we started to work more on making a script that would use Ansible to install and run Podman, but we began to run into complications. While we searched for solutions, we found that our project had already been created by another person. We got together as a team and communicated with the client, who also acted as our project manager, about our discovery and asked him what he would like to do. He responded that he didn’t want to waste our time “reinventing the wheel,” so he gave us two options: start a completely new project, or change the direction of our project to making scripts that would install Podman Machine for both Windows and Mac. After talking over the details, we decided that we would rather change the project’s direction. Our reasoning behind changing direction rather than creating an entirely new project was that we would likely face more issues getting the resources required for a new project, and, since we were in the second semester, would have little development time to make our new project. Since we had two separate scripts to work on, we decided to split our team up into three people, Aaron, Jonah, and Dustin, working on making a script that would use Homebrew to install Podman Machine on a Mac, and another team of three, Paul, Jacob, and Trey, working on a script that would use Chochlatey to install Podman Machine on Windows. Because the scope of these two new projects was less expansive, we thought that smaller teams would be better suited<p>

<p>This project was a great experience for all us, and it was fun to work with real world tools and create something that would be used in the industry. Working on our own turnkey installation with Ansible for so long, only to learn about the existence of podman-machine reinforced why we should work in an agile manner. We were able to switch projects quickly and begin working on our new packages immediately. It also taught us the importance and usefulness of packages to distribute software to users. We all had downloaded packages before, but creating packages provides a different perspective on how much work they are doing for the user. Of course, working on this project has reinforced and possibly improved our teamwork and communication skills. Throughout the project all of us agree that our communication with each other and collaboration on difficult tasks was impeccable and allowed us to make good progress while keeping the quality of our work to the standard we had set for ourselves. We would like to thank our client, Andrew Roth, for helping us throughout the project, and providing us with valuable insight to the industry that will help us in our future endeavors. We hope that our work is adopted by the open source community and further improved, and that by creating this we have filled a need for a turnkey solution to install podman-machine on both Windows and MacOS.</p>
