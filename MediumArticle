“Failure is only the opportunity to begin again more intelligently” - Henry Ford.  Podman is a container engine like docker that allows you to create and run containers that run programs so that you don’t have to install anything on a new system. The only issue with Podman is that it is extremely difficult to install on a mac. Our Solution was to create a turnkey solution to install Podman with minimal effort from the user. The team was comprised of 6 senior students studying computer science at Tennessee Tech University. During the fall semester of 2019, we were giving this problem by our client to solve as our capstone project. Our team was chosen by our professors based on similarities and compatibility. Team worked on the project throughout the remaining fall semester and all throughout the spring semester. We started out by creating an ansible script to install and setup Podman. Although we ran into some issues early on, we forged ahead and soon learned that plans can easily be changed.
